## About Me

I used to be a design engineer at a factory and later I have decided I want to work with Web. I have started my path as a web designer and a digital artist. Later I have realized I am more interested in the engineering part of Web so I have decided to be a frontend engineer and I believe that I have all the necessary skills to succeed. I have a high ability to learn and to stay motivated during the learning process. I am a highly responsible and friendly person who enjoys teamwork.
